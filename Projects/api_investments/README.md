# API INVESTMENTS

<br>

-  Enviroment Notes: 
```
Node version: v16.13.0
MongoDB version: 5.0.4
```

<br>

- First of all, you can edit the necessary values in the .ENV file (Or create if it is the first run) For practical purposes of this Challenge, I will leave the one I use, although it is not a good practice.

<br>

> Execution:
```
- Position yourself in the same path as this README.md in the CMD or Terminal.
- Run "npm i"
- Run "npm start" (localhost:3000 by default or value from the .ENV file).
- Use the pre-configured set of Postman or make a POST request to "api/accounts" with the corresponding body and endpoint.
- Generate response.
```

> Errors:
```
- In case of generating errors, they appear at the bottom of the response according to the format given in the Challenge.
```
